#### Basic Functions

This zennote package aims to provide you with an easy interface to speed up the process when organizing and producing elegant notes.
All the tables, figures, equations, and listings are labeled according to the notenumber with the \titlebox command.
The noteframe environment helps you generate fancy colored boxes to emphasize the important information (e.g. Theorems, Equations, Proof, etc.) in your document. You can customize the style and color to denote different categories, too.
